Settings
=============

* Setting up Plug & Play
* Setting up PoderVocabulary
* Setting up Solr
* Setting up DocumentCloud

## Setting up Plug & Play

There are 3 main config files in the models directory:

* 0.py - contains all mayor settings (database_uri, meta-content, application name, mail-server settings, etc.)
* 0_memcached - the connection config for the memcached server.
* document_cloud.py - contains the credentials to autentificate in DocumentCloud.org.

You must write your settings in these 3 files.

## Setting up PoderVocabulary

## Setting up Solr
