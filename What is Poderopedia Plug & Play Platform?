Poderopedia Plug & Play Platform is a Data Intelligence Semantic Management
System that provides media organizations and private companies a new data 
toolkit and revenue model, by allowing them to create and manage large semantic
datasets of information about entities, to show and map their connections,
related documents, information sources and news mentions.

Poderopedia Plug & Play Platform is built on top of open source technology, it's
award winning research methodology and it's own semantic ontology that turns the
entities information into linked data, readable by machines. The Platform
provides journalist -who don't know how to code- a way to create data
visualizations by simply adding connections in a form built into Plug & Play.

The Platform enables to define roles and editing permissions, receive
collaborations from registered users, permit users to embed profiles and data
visualizations in other websites and last but not least: display all the
information in a public or private website, that can work as standalone product
or as a public searchable database that can interoperate with a Newsroom`s
website providing rich contextual information for news content using it's
archive.
