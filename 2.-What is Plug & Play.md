information in a public or private website, that can work as standalone product
or as a public searchable database that can interoperate with a Newsroom`s
website providing rich contextual information for news content using it's
archive.

**Problems Poderopedia Plug & Play Platform helps to solve**

In most countries in the world, but specially in under developed and third world countries,
the elites, companies, businessmen and politicians are very much inter connected.
Their members have the same last names, they marry each other, they go to the
same schools and universities, are members of the same private clubs, secular and
non secular groups and have strong political and business ties.

Decisions that become news and affect people`s every day life for good or bad are
made by this influential people, companies and institutions. Having the big
picture of who is who in business and politics and their networks helps you
understand why things happen in one way or another, cuts information asymmetry,
helps everyone to make more informed decisions, makes powerful people more
accountable of their acts and promotes better democracy and a healthier society.
